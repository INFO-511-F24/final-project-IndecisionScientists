## Introduction and data

**U.S. Natural Resources Revenue (2003-2023)**

-   **Source:** Kaggle - <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhbadole/u-s-natural-resources-revenue-2003-2023>

-   **Collection date/method:** Data spanning 2003 to present collected and managed by the Department of the Interior's Office of Natural Resources Revenue

-   **Description:** This dataset comprises revenue generated from and attributes of natural U.S. resources such as federal lands, waters, and indigenous lands. Data includes land classification, lease types, revenue types, and commodities/products that are extracted from the natural resources.

-   **Ethical concerns:** Revenue data for indigenous/Native American resources was only reported at a national level to protect private/sensitive information

    ```{python}
    natResRev = pd.read_csv("data/us_natResources_revenue.csv")
    ```

## Research Question

**U.S. Natural Resources Revenue (2003-2023)**

-   **Research question:** In what ways have revenue patterns from renewable versus non-renewable resource extraction (e.g., geothermal, oil, and gas) evolved over the past two decades, and how does the interaction between resource type and land category (onshore versus offshore) influence these revenue trends across different regions?

-   **Importance:** This question leverages the datasetâ€™s extensive time span and diverse resource categories, addressing the critical topic of renewable versus non-renewable energy. It enables an exploration of long-term trends, analysis by land type, and comparisons across revenue sources, providing a relevant perspective on the economics of sustainable energy.

-   **Description:** This research examines revenue trends from renewable and non-renewable resources on federal and Native American lands over the past two decades, focusing on differences between onshore and offshore land categories. The study aims to reveal whether renewable resource revenue, particularly from geothermal energy, has grown over time relative to non-renewables like oil and gas. The hypothesis is that revenue from renewable resources has increased over time, while offshore lands generate higher revenue from non-renewables, and onshore lands contribute more to renewables. Additionally, non-renewable revenue remains high but fluctuates due to market and policy changes.

-   **Variable types:**

    -   **Categorical:** Land Category, State, Commodity

    -   **Quantitative:** Revenue, Calendar Year

## Analysis plan

**U.S. Natural Resources Revenue (2003-2023)**

-   **Plan:** Data wrangling will initially be required to create variables that group U.S. states into geographic regions so that we can compare the Revenue patterns across Calendar Years between Commodity types, Land Category, and geographic regions. We will also group renewable resources versus non-renewable resources. The comparisons will then primarily be done by constructing a variety of data visualizations.

-   **Variables to be created:** A categorical variable will be needed to identify whether a resource is considered renewable or non-renewable. Another categorical variable would be created to identify which geographic region a state that has a particular resource belongs to (e.g., Texas would be in the Southern region, etc.).

-   **External data:** No external data to be merged.
