## Introduction and data

1.  **Remote Work & Mental Health**

    -   **Source:** Kaggle - <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/remote-work-and-mental-health>

    -   **Collection date/method:** Data uploaded in September 2024 and collected from a variety of sources via the digital distribution of a structured questionnaire that anonymized responses on social media platforms, professional networks, and online forums

    -   **Description:** This dataset comprises 5,000 employee records worldwide with details about work location, stress levels, mental health resource access, job satisfaction, and demographics (age, gender, industry, etc.)

    -   **Ethical concerns:** N/A

        ```{python}
        remoteMH = pd.read_csv("data/RemoteWork_MentalHealth.csv")
        ```

2.  **U.S. Natural Resources Revenue (2003-2023)**

    -   **Source:** Kaggle - <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhbadole/u-s-natural-resources-revenue-2003-2023>

    -   **Collection date/method:** Data spanning 2003 to present collected and managed by the Department of the Interior's Office of Natural Resources Revenue

    -   **Description:** This dataset comprises revenue generated from and attributes of natural U.S. resources such as federal lands, waters, and indigenous lands. Data includes land classification, lease types, revenue types, and commodities/products that are extracted from the natural resources.

    -   **Ethical concerns:** Revenue data for indigenous/Native American resources was only reported at a national level to protect private/sensitive information

        ```{python}
        natResRev = pd.read_csv("data/us_natResources_revenue.csv")
        ```

3.  **Global Earthquake Data**

    -   **Source:** Kaggle - <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shreyasur965/recent-earthquakes>

    -   **Collection date/method:** Data collected using the *EveryEarthquake* API from *RapidAPI* with earthquakes from 6/23/2023 through 9/18/2024

    -   **Description:** This dataset comprises attributes and other details of 1,137 earthquakes from around the world including magnitude, location, date, time, and other measurements used in seismology

    -   **Ethical concerns:** N/A

        ```{python}
        quakes = pd.read_csv("data/earthquakes.csv")
        ```

## Research Question

Your research question should contain at least three variables, and should be a mix of categorical and quantitative variables. When writing a research question, please think about the following:

-   What is your target population?

-   Is the question original?

-   Can the question be answered?

For each data set, include the following:

-   A well formulated research question. (You may include more than one research question if you want to receive feedback on different ideas for your project. However, one per data set is required.)

-   Statement on why this question is important.

-   A description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.

-   Identify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?

1.  **Remote Work & Mental Health**

    -   **Research question:** \[A well formulated research question requiring at least 3 variables with a mix of categorical and quantitative data types\]
    -   **Importance:** \[Statement on why this question is important\]
    -   **Description:** \[A description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic\]
    -   **Variable types:** \[Identify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\]

2.  **U.S. Natural Resources Revenue (2003-2023)**

    -   **Research question:** In what ways have revenue patterns from renewable versus non-renewable resource extraction (e.g., geothermal, oil, and gas) evolved over the past two decades, and how does the interaction between resource type and land category (onshore versus offshore) influence these revenue trends across different regions?
    -   **Importance:** This question leverages the datasetâ€™s extensive time span and diverse resource categories, addressing the critical topic of renewable versus non-renewable energy. It enables an exploration of long-term trends, analysis by land type, and comparisons across revenue sources, providing a relevant perspective on the economics of sustainable energy.
    -   **Description:** This research examines revenue trends from renewable and non-renewable resources on federal and Native American lands over the past two decades, focusing on differences between onshore and offshore land categories. The study aims to reveal whether renewable resource revenue, particularly from geothermal energy, has grown over time relative to non-renewables like oil and gas. The hypothesis is that revenue from renewable resources has increased over time, while offshore lands generate higher revenue from non-renewables, and onshore lands contribute more to renewables. Additionally, non-renewable revenue remains high but fluctuates due to market and policy changes.
    -   **Variable types:** 
        -  Categorical: Commodity, Land Category 
        -  Quantitative: Revenue, Calendar Year

3.  **Global Earthquake Data**

    -   **Research question:** Can we predict the impact and measure of an earthquake based on various factors, such as location, date, time, magnitude, or depth?

    -   **Importance:** It would be nice to predict the impact of an earthquake to give estimations on recovery times/efforts needed by local governments if they we can accurately predict the impact.

    -   **Description:** This topic covers earthquake data from around the world. Our hypothesis would be: you can predict the measure of impact an earthquake has based on various features of an earthquake.

    -   **Variable types:**

        -   Time and date: object

        -   Magnitude, depth, felt, cdi, mmi, sig, rms, gap: number

        -   Continent, country, alert: categorical

## Analysis plan

1.  **Remote Work & Mental Health**

    -   **Plan:** \[A plan for answering the research question(s) including the variables involved\]
    -   **Variables to be created:** \[Variables to be created (if any)\]
    -   **External data:** \[External data to be merged in (if any)\]

2.  **U.S. Natural Resources Revenue (2003-2023)**

    -   **Plan:** \[A plan for answering the research question(s) including the variables involved\]
    -   **Variables to be created:** \[Variables to be created (if any)\]
    -   **External data:** \[External data to be merged in (if any)\]

3.  **Global Earthquake Data**

    -   **Plan:** We will need to be more familiar with the type of earthquake features (e.g., cdi, rms, gap) to understand the features that are available for us to use. We will need to take a closer look at the data and then filter out any unnecessary features, and conduct data visualization.

    -   **Variables to be created:** Currently there are no variables expected to be created.

    -   **External data:** No external data to be merged
