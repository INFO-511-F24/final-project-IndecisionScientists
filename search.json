Data includes land classification, lease types, revenue types, and commodities/products that are extracted from the natural resources.\nEthical concerns: Revenue data for indigenous/Native American resources was only reported at a national level to protect private/sensitive information\n\nnatResRev = pd.read_csv(\"data/us_natResources_revenue.csv\")"

    "text": "Research Question\n\nResearch question: In what ways have revenue patterns from renewable versus non-renewable resource extraction (e.g., geothermal, oil, and gas) evolved over the past two decades, and how does the interaction between resource type and land category (onshore versus offshore) influence these revenue trends across different regions?\nImportance: This question leverages the dataset’s extensive time span and diverse resource categories, addressing the critical topic of renewable versus non-renewable energy. It enables an exploration of long-term trends, analysis by land type, and comparisons across revenue sources, providing a relevant perspective on the economics of sustainable energy.\nDescription: This research examines revenue trends from renewable and non-renewable resources on federal and Native American lands over the past two decades, focusing on differences between onshore and offshore land categories. The study aims to reveal whether renewable resource revenue, particularly from geothermal energy, has grown over time relative to non-renewables like oil and gas. The hypothesis is that revenue from renewable resources has increased over time, while offshore lands generate higher revenue from non-renewables, and onshore lands contribute more to renewables. Additionally, non-renewable revenue remains high but fluctuates due to market and policy changes.\nVariable types:\n\nCategorical: Land Category, State, Commodity\nQuantitative: Revenue, Calendar Year"

We will also group renewable resources versus non-renewable resources. The comparisons will then primarily be done by constructing a variety of data visualizations.\nVariables to be created: A categorical variable will be needed to identify whether a resource is considered renewable or non-renewable. Another categorical variable would be created to identify which geographic region a state that has a particular resource belongs to (e.g., Texas would be in the Southern region, etc.).\nExternal data: No external data to be merged."
