# Introduction

## Topic & Motivation

-   Introduce the project's topic and motivation for our research questions here

## Data

-   Introduce the project data here

## Exploratory Data Analyses

-   Focus was on state revenue.

-   Originally created a choropleth of state colored by a range of the minimum and maximum revenue.

-   We found it hard to distinguish between overly high performing states and high performing states.

---

![](images/20YearRevenueByState.png)

-   E.g., NM=32B, UT=4.23B, however both are colored yellow.

---

-   To further differentiate, we used a logarithmic scaling

---

-   Could also compare revenue by region, and see that Pacific & Western North Central outweigh all others.

---

![](images/Top5Commodities.png)

-   Many commodities found, so we only reviewed the top 5.

-   Oil was the highest producing.

-   This data is across all states, not stratified by region.

# Results

## Results & Additional Analyses

-   Inference/modeling/other analysis shared here

-   Address answers to research question(s)

-   Can use 1-2 slides for this

## Conclusions & Future Considerations

-   Summary of what was learned about research question(s) and statistical arguments supporting our conclusions

-   Summary of limitations

-   Ideas for how future studies can build upon our findings

## Will delete this slide and everything after

-   Everything after this slide consists of default slides provided by Dr. Chism for guidance

-   Leaving them until we're ready to finalize our slide deck for reference

# Using Quarto for presentations

## Quarto

-   The presentation is created using the Quarto CLI

-   `##` sets the start of a new slide

## Layouts

You can use plain text

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   or bullet points[^1]
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
or in two columns
:::
:::::

[^1]: And add footnotes

## Code

```{python}
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import statsmodels.api as sm
import pandas as pd

# Fit a linear regression model
X = mtcars[['speed']]
y = mtcars['mpg']
model = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)

# Summary of the model
X2 = sm.add_constant(X)
est = sm.OLS(y, X2)
est2 = est.fit()
print(est2.summary())
```

## Plots

```{python}
penguins['species'] = penguins['species'].apply(lambda x: "Adelie" if x == "Adelie" else "Other")
sns.scatterplot(data=penguins, x='flipper_length_mm', y='body_mass_g', hue='species')
plt.show()
```

## Plot and text

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Some text

-   goes here
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{python}
#| warning: false
#| fig.width: 5.5
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5.5, 5.5 * 0.618))
sns.boxplot(data=penguins, x='bill_length_mm', y='species', hue='species', ax=ax)
plt.show()
```

## Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{python}
penguins.head().to_html()
```

## Images

## Math Expressions {.smaller}

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g.Â \$\\alpha+\\beta\$ renders $\alpha + \beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```         
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$
\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i
$$

Limitations:

1.  The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

2.  There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

# Wrap up

## Feeling adventurous?

-   You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

-   But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. Some solutions for this can be found at https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs.
