## Abstract

As a culminating project to showcase skills from INFO 511: Fundamentals of Data Science, the Indecision Scientists team aims to examine revenue trends from renewable and non-renewable resources on federal and Native American lands in the United States over the past two decades. This exploration of long-term trends, analysis by land type, and comparisons across revenue sources can provide a relevant perspective on the economics of sustainable energy and reveal whether renewable resource revenue, particularly from geothermal energy, has grown over time relative to non-renewables like oil and gas.

## Introduction

-   Introduction to the project motivation, data, and research question.
    -   Include citations for external research

## Data

-   Describe the data and definitions of key variables.
    -   Include how data were collected
    -   Clearly describe data cleaning process (e.g., creating new variables, removing observations, etc.)
-   Include some exploratory data analysis. Focus on the EDA for the response variable and a few other interesting variables and relationships.
    -   Incorporate appropriate visualizations and summary statistics

## Methodology

-   Brief description of your analysis process.
-   Explain the reasoning for the types of analyses you do, exploratory, inferential, or modeling.
    -   If you’ve chosen to do inference, make sure to include a justification for why that inferential approach is appropriate.
    -   If you’ve chosen to do modeling, describe the model(s) you’re fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions.
-   Show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, interactions considered, variable transformations (if needed), assessment of conditions and diagnostics, and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.
    -   Address any concerns over appropriateness of analyses chosen

### Overall Findings

Our analysis explored how revenue patterns from renewable versus non-renewable resource extraction have evolved over the past two decades and examined how the interaction between resource type (renewable vs. non-renewable) and land category (onshore vs. offshore) influences these trends across different regions.

### Key Results

**1. Revenue Evolution of Resources:**

-   **Non-Renewable Resources:**

    -   Exhibit a clear upward trend in revenue over time, especially post-2020, indicating a potential rise in demand or price fluctuations.
    -   Sharp fluctuations reflect significant market volatility, which is typical for sectors dependent on external factors such as global demand or geopolitical issues.

-   **Renewable Resources:**

    -   Revenue remains flat with only minimal growth over the years.
    -   This pattern suggests slower adoption or lower revenue generation in comparison to non-renewables, highlighting a lag in renewable resource development or market integration.

**2. Onshore vs. Offshore Contributions:**

-   Onshore resources, particularly in the non-renewable sector, have been the dominant drivers of revenue across most regions.
-   Offshore resources contribute minimal revenue, particularly in renewable sectors, indicating that offshore extraction (for both non-renewables and renewables) has not reached the same level of economic significance.

### Key Insights

-   Non-renewable onshore resources continue to lead in terms of revenue generation, reflecting significant growth but also volatility due to market fluctuations.
-   Offshore resources, including both renewable and non-renewable, show little revenue impact, with offshore renewable resources contributing especially low values.

## Discussion

-   Summary of what you have learned about your research question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions.
-   Discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved.
    -   Any potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here.
-   Include ideas for future work.
-   Consider long-term sustainability and transition to alternate revenue streams for high producing states of non-renewable resources is suggested to prevent a lapse in economic growth and resource utilization.
-   Conduct regressive time-series analyses for future economic activity would provide benefit to institutions for impacts such as employment and infrastructure requirements.
