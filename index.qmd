## Abstract

As a culminating project to showcase skills from INFO 511: Fundamentals of Data Science, the Indecision Scientists team aims to examine revenue trends from renewable and non-renewable resources on federal and Native American lands in the United States over the past two decades. This exploration of long-term trends, analysis by land type, and comparisons across revenue sources can provide a relevant perspective on the economics of sustainable energy and reveal whether renewable resource revenue, particularly from geothermal energy, has grown over time relative to non-renewables like oil and gas.
