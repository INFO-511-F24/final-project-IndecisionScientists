When writing a research question, please think about the following:\n\n-   What is your target population?\n\n-   Is the question original?\n\n-   Can the question be answered?\n\nFor each data set, include the following:\n\n-   A well formulated research question. (You may include more than one research question if you want to receive feedback on different ideas for your project. However, one per data set is required.)\n\n-   Statement on why this question is important.\n\n-   A description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\n\n-   Identify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\n\n1.  **Remote Work & Mental Health**\n\n    -   **Research question:** \\[A well formulated research question requiring at least 3 variables with a mix of categorical and quantitative data types\\]\n    -   **Importance:** \\[Statement on why this question is important\\]\n    -   **Description:** \\[A description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic\\]\n    -   **Variable types:** \\[Identify the types of variables in your research question.
