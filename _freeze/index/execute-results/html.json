This exploration of long-term trends, analysis by land type, and comparisons across revenue sources can provide a relevant perspective on the economics of sustainable energy and reveal whether renewable resource revenue, particularly from geothermal energy, has grown over time relative to non-renewables like oil and gas.\n\n",
